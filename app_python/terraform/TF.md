## Best Practices applied
By following these best practices, we ensure a secure, manageable, and reliable Terraform setup for managing GitHub repository infrastructure.

### 1. Secure Storage of Sensitive Data
Using Environment Variables for Sensitive Tokens

- **Description**: We used an environment variable (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) to store and access the GitHub personal access token securely.
- **Reason**: Storing sensitive information such as API tokens in environment variables prevents exposing these credentials directly in configuration files, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
- **Implementation**: The `github_token` variable in Terraform references this environment variable, ensuring it remains secure.

### 2. Resource Importation for Existing Infrastructure
Importing Existing GitHub Repository

- **Description**: Instead of creating a new GitHub repository, we used the `terraform import` command to import an existing repository into Terraformâ€™s state.
- **Reason**: This approach allows Terraform to manage existing infrastructure without recreating resources, preserving existing data and settings.
- **Implementation**: We ensured the correct repository name in the `terraform import` command and verified the resource with `terraform state list` to avoid duplication.

### 3. Use of Resource Blocks Following Provider Requirements
Following Provider-Specific Naming and Attribute Requirements

- **Description**: We adhered to GitHub provider constraints by avoiding special characters (e.g., slashes) in the `name` field of the `github_repository` resource and removed creation-only attributes (e.g., `auto_init`) when managing existing resources.
- **Reason**: Ensuring compliance with provider-specific rules and limitations helps prevent errors during resource creation or import.
- **Implementation**: We formatted the repository name and attributes according to Terraform and GitHub provider requirements, allowing Terraform to interact smoothly with GitHub's API.

### 4. Configuration Modularity and Reusability

Separating Configuration into Modular Blocks
- **Description**: We organized the GitHub repository and branch protection configurations into separate resource blocks.
- **Reason**: Separating different parts of the configuration (e.g., repository setup and branch protection rules) improves readability, makes it easier to update, and supports modularity.
- **Implementation**: We defined `github_repository` and `github_branch_protection` as distinct blocks, making each part of the setup clear and manageable.

### 5. Documentation of Outputs
Providing Resource Outputs

- **Description**: The configuration includes an output block that displays the repository URL after it has been imported or created.
- **Reason**: Outputs are useful for capturing essential information, making it easy for users and downstream processes to access relevant details without checking individual resource configurations.
- **Implementation**: We added an output for `repository_url`, which provides easy access to the URL of the managed repository after each `terraform apply`.
